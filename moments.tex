	\section{Expected case reproductive number $R_c$}	
	\subsection{A model with a more general incidence term}
Assume that the following relation between the incidence, $i$, and the expected reproductive number is true
	\begin{subequations} 
		\label{eq_CaseReproductiveNumber}
		\begin{align}
	C(\tau, \rho) &= \int_{t = \tau}^{t= \rho} h(t) dt,\\
	\omega (\tau, \rho) & = i(\tau) f(\rho - \tau),\\
	i(t) & = h(t) y(t),
	\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $h(t)$ is some function of states and, in turn, time, and
	$y(t)$ is the proportion of infectious individuals.
	
	If so, it appears that the functional form of $h(t)$ does not matter. Please see below. 
	
	The second raw moment of the expected case reproductive number $C(\tau,\rho)$ reads as follows
	\begin{small}
		\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align} 
		C_2 &= \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{\rho = \tau}^\infty i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau \int_{t=\tau}^{\rho} \int_{s=\tau}^{\rho} h(t) h(s) dt ds\\
		&= 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{\rho = \tau}^\infty 
		\int_{t=s}^{\rho} \int_{s=\tau}^{t}i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau  h(t) h(s) dt ds\\
		& = 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds \underbrace{\int_{\rho = t}^\infty f(\rho - \tau) d\rho}_{F(t-\tau)} \label{eq_before_Markovian}\\
		& = 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds \underbrace{F(t-\tau)}_{F(t-s)F(s-\tau)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=s}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t h(t) F(t-s)h(s)ds\underbrace{\int_{\tau = 0}^{s} d\tau i(\tau)F(s-\tau)}_{y(s)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=0}^\infty \int_{s=0}^t h(t)ds F(t-s)\underbrace{h(s) y(s)}_{i(s)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=0}^\infty  h(t) \underbrace{\int_{s=0}^t ds F(t-s){i(s)}}_{y(t)}\\
		& = 2 \underbrace{\int_{t=0}^\infty i(t) dt}_{Z} \\
		& = 2Z \label{eq_C2final}
		\end{align}
		\end{subequations}
	\end{small}
\subsection*{Numerical Simulations}
For simulation, we consider the following compartmental model
\begin{subequations} \label{eq_Erlang}
	\begin{align}
	\dot{x} &= -\beta(t) x^{\kappa + 1}y + m\sigma z ,\\
	\dot{y}_1 &= \beta(t) x^{\kappa +1}y - my_1,\\
	& \vdots\\
	\dot{y}_m &= my_{m-1} - m y_m,\\
	\dot{z} &= my_m - m\sigma z,
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where 
$\beta(t) = \beta_0\exp(\alpha\sin(\omega t))$.

The incidence for the model in \Cref{eq_Erlang} is defined by 
$$i(t) = \beta(t) x^{\kappa + 1}(t) y(t),$$
and the expected case reproductive number of individuals got infected at time $\tau$ and recovered at time $\rho$ is formulated as 
$$C(\tau, \rho) = \int_{\tau}^{\rho} \beta(t) x^{\kappa +1} dt.$$

\subsection{Erlang infectious periods don't allow variance	above one}
The survival function  of Erlang distribution is equal to 
$$
F(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \frac{1}{n!} e^{-m t} (m t)^n.
$$
It has been shown that the Erlang distribution has an increasing failure rate, i.e., $\ln F(t)$ is concave, which, in turn, implies the following property \cite{marshall1972classes}
\begin{equation}
F(a +b) < F(a) F(b). \label{eq_submultiplicative}
\end{equation}
Given \eqref{eq_CaseReproductiveNumber} and in view of  \eqref{eq_before_Markovian}, the second raw moment of $C(\tau, \rho)$
equals 
\begin{align*}
C_2 &= 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds F(t-\tau)\\
 &\overset{\eqref{eq_submultiplicative}}{<} 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds F(t-s)F(s-\tau)\\
\xrightarrow{\eqref{eq_C2final}} & < 2Z.
\end{align*}
Previously it has been shown that the mean of the expected case reproductive number, regardless of the infectious period distribution, is one yielding
$$
\frac{C_2}{Z} - 1 < 1.
$$

	The rate of waning immunity $\sigma$ is set to $0.1$.
	$\kappa$ is set to one.
	Other simulation details are the same as those in \Cref{fig_Rc_seasonally}.

	\subsection{Higher moments of the case reproductive number}
\begin{align*}
C(\tau, \rho) &= \beta \int_{t = \tau}^{t= \rho} x(t) dt,\\
\omega (\tau, \rho) & = i(\tau) f(\rho - \tau),\\
i(t) & = \beta x(t) y(t),
\end{align*}
where $x(t)$ and
$y(t)$  are the proportions of susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, 
$\omega(\tau, \rho)$ is the size of individuals infected at time point $\tau$ and recovered at time point $\rho$,
$f(t)$ is the distribution of residence time in the infectious compartment, and $i(t)$ is the incidence at time point $t$.


The $k^\text{th}$ raw moment of the expected case reproductive number $C(\tau,\rho)$ reads as
	\begin{align*} 
	C_k &= \int \int i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\tau d\rho \big (\int_{\tau}^{\rho} \beta x(s) ds \big )^k \\
	&= \beta^k \int \int i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\tau d\rho \underbrace{\int_{\tau}^{\rho} \cdots \int_{\tau}^{\rho}}_{k \text{ times}} x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k
	\end{align*}
	The integral of the symmetric $k$-variable function $x(t_1)\ldots x(t_k)$  over the hybercube $[\tau, \rho]^k$ is equal to $k!$ times the integral of the function over the region $\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k < \rho$.
	Hence, we have
	\begin{align*}
	&= k! \beta^k \int_{\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k < \rho} \int \underbrace{\int \ldots \int}_{k \text{ times}}
	i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k  \\
	&= k! \beta^k \int_{\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k } \underbrace{\int \ldots \int}_{k \text{ times}}
	i(\tau)  d\tau x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k  \underbrace{\int_{\rho = t_k}^\infty f(\rho - \tau) d\rho}_{F(t_k-\tau)}
	\end{align*}
	Using the Markovian property, we have
	\(F(t_k - \tau) = F(t_k - t_{k-1})\times F(t_{k-1} - t_{k-2}) \times \ldots \times F(t_1 - \tau) \).
	By defining $t_0$ as $\tau$,
	the term $ \int_{t_l<t_{l+1}} dt_l i(t_l) F(t_{l+1} - t_l)$, for $l \in {0,\ldots,k-1}$, is equal to $y(t_{l+1})$.
	The multiplication of $y(t_{l+1})$ and $\beta x(t_{l+1})$ equals $i(t_{l+1}).$ 
	By repeating the same procedure for $k$ times,
	the remaining element would be $k! \int i(t_k) dt_k$.
	Hence, the $k$th normalized moment, defined as $C_k/Z$ is equal to $k!.$
	
	We calculated the third and fourth normalized moments of $R_c$ for a simple SIR model.

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Codes/plots/highermoments.pdf}
	\caption{Simulation results support the conjecture that the third and fourth normalized raw moments are equal to $3!=6$ and $4!=24$ regardless of $R_0$ in a simple SIR model.}

	\section{Instantaneous case reproductive number}
For the following SIR model,
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= - \beta(t)yx,\\
\dot{y} &= \beta(t) yx -y,
\end{align*}
we define the instantaneous case reproductive number associated with cohorts infected at time point $\tau$ as 
\[R_i(\tau) = \beta(\tau)x(\tau).\]
%Zeroth moment of $R_i$ is defined as
%\begin{align*}
%R_0 
%&= \int_{\tau} i(\tau) \\
%&= Z.
%\end{align*}
%The first raw moment of $R_i$ is then equal to 
%\begin{align*}
%R_1 &= \int_{\tau}d\tau i(\tau)\beta(\tau) x(\tau)
%\end{align*}
%The second raw moment of $R_i$ is equal to 
%\begin{align*}
%R_2 &= \int_{\tau} d\tau  i(\tau)  \beta^2(\tau) x^2(\tau) 
%\end{align*}
