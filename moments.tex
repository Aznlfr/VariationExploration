	\section{Expected case reproductive number $R_c$}	
	\subsection{A model with a more general incidence term}
Assume that the following relation between the incidence, $i$, and the expected reproductive number is true
	\begin{subequations} 
		\label{eq_CaseReproductiveNumber}
		\begin{align}
	C(\tau, \rho) &= \int_{t = \tau}^{t= \rho} h(t) dt,\\
	\omega (\tau, \rho) & = i(\tau) f(\rho - \tau),\\
	i(t) & = h(t) y(t),
	\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	where $h(t)$ is some function of states and, in turn, time, and
	$y(t)$ is the proportion of infectious individuals.
	
	If so, it appears that the functional form of $h(t)$ does not matter. Please see below. 
	
	The second raw moment of the expected case reproductive number $C(\tau,\rho)$ reads as follows
	\begin{small}
		\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align} 
		C_2 &= \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{\rho = \tau}^\infty i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau \int_{t=\tau}^{\rho} \int_{s=\tau}^{\rho} h(t) h(s) dt ds\\
		&= 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{\rho = \tau}^\infty 
		\int_{t=s}^{\rho} \int_{s=\tau}^{t}i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau  h(t) h(s) dt ds\\
		& = 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds \underbrace{\int_{\rho = t}^\infty f(\rho - \tau) d\rho}_{F(t-\tau)} \label{eq_before_Markovian}\\
		& = 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds \underbrace{F(t-\tau)}_{F(t-s)F(s-\tau)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=s}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t h(t) F(t-s)h(s)ds\underbrace{\int_{\tau = 0}^{s} d\tau i(\tau)F(s-\tau)}_{y(s)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=0}^\infty \int_{s=0}^t h(t)ds F(t-s)\underbrace{h(s) y(s)}_{i(s)}\\
		& = 2  \int_{t=0}^\infty  h(t) \underbrace{\int_{s=0}^t ds F(t-s){i(s)}}_{y(t)}\\
		& = 2 \underbrace{\int_{t=0}^\infty i(t) dt}_{Z} \\
		& = 2Z \label{eq_C2final}
		\end{align}
		\end{subequations}
	\end{small}
\subsection*{Numerical Simulations}
For simulation, we consider the following compartmental model
\begin{subequations} \label{eq_Erlang}
	\begin{align}
	\dot{x} &= -\beta(t) x^{\kappa + 1}y + m\sigma z ,\\
	\dot{y}_1 &= \beta(t) x^{\kappa +1}y - my_1,\\
	& \vdots\\
	\dot{y}_m &= my_{m-1} - m y_m,\\
	\dot{z} &= my_m - m\sigma z,
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where 
$\beta(t) = \beta_0\exp(\alpha\sin(\omega t))$.

The incidence for the model in \Cref{eq_Erlang} is defined by 
$$i(t) = \beta(t) x^{\kappa + 1}(t) y(t),$$
and the expected case reproductive number of individuals got infected at time $\tau$ and recovered at time $\rho$ is formulated as 
$$C(\tau, \rho) = \int_{\tau}^{\rho} \beta(t) x^{\kappa +1} dt.$$

	\subsection{Higher moments of the case reproductive number}
\begin{align*}
C(\tau, \rho) &= \beta \int_{t = \tau}^{t= \rho} x(t) dt,\\
\omega (\tau, \rho) & = i(\tau) f(\rho - \tau),\\
i(t) & = \beta x(t) y(t),
\end{align*}
where $x(t)$ and
$y(t)$  are the proportions of susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, 
$\omega(\tau, \rho)$ is the size of individuals infected at time point $\tau$ and recovered at time point $\rho$,
$f(t)$ is the distribution of residence time in the infectious compartment, and $i(t)$ is the incidence at time point $t$.


The $k^\text{th}$ raw moment of the expected case reproductive number $C(\tau,\rho)$ reads as
	\begin{align*} 
	C_k &= \int \int i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\tau d\rho \big (\int_{\tau}^{\rho} \beta x(s) ds \big )^k \\
	&= \beta^k \int \int i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\tau d\rho \underbrace{\int_{\tau}^{\rho} \cdots \int_{\tau}^{\rho}}_{k \text{ times}} x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k
	\end{align*}
	The integral of the symmetric $k$-variable function $x(t_1)\ldots x(t_k)$  over the hybercube $[\tau, \rho]^k$ is equal to $k!$ times the integral of the function over the region $\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k < \rho$.
	Hence, we have
	\begin{align*}
	&= k! \beta^k \int_{\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k < \rho} \int \underbrace{\int \ldots \int}_{k \text{ times}}
	i(\tau) f(\rho-\tau) d\rho d\tau x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k  \\
	&= k! \beta^k \int_{\tau<t_1<t_2<\ldots<t_k } \underbrace{\int \ldots \int}_{k \text{ times}}
	i(\tau)  d\tau x(t_1) \ldots x(t_k) dt_1 \ldots dt_k  \underbrace{\int_{\rho = t_k}^\infty f(\rho - \tau) d\rho}_{F(t_k-\tau)}
	\end{align*}
	Using the Markovian property, we have
	\(F(t_k - \tau) = F(t_k - t_{k-1})\times F(t_{k-1} - t_{k-2}) \times \ldots \times F(t_1 - \tau) \).
	By defining $t_0$ as $\tau$,
	the term $ \int_{t_l<t_{l+1}} dt_l i(t_l) F(t_{l+1} - t_l)$, for $l \in \{0,\ldots,k-1\}$, is equal to $y(t_{l+1})$.
	The multiplication of $y(t_{l+1})$ and $\beta x(t_{l+1})$ equals $i(t_{l+1}).$ 
	By repeating the same procedure for $k$ times,
	the remaining element would be $k! \int i(t_k) dt_k$.
	Hence, the $k$th normalized raw moment, defined as $C_k/Z$ is equal to $k!.$
	
	In other words, the distribution of the case reproductive number is exponential with rate $1$.
	
	We calculated the third and fourth normalized moments of $R_c$ for a simple SIR model.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.2\linewidth]{figs/ErlangMoments.Rout.pdf}
	\caption{The mean, variance, third, and  fourth normalized raw moments of $R_c$.
		Simulation results support the theory that the third and fourth normalized raw moments are equal to $3!=6$ and $4!=24$ regardless of the value for $\beta_0$ in a simple SIR model $(m=1)$.
	However, it is not the case for Erlang distribution $(m=2,4)$.
	$\alpha$ and $\sigma$ are set to zero, and the duration of the simulation is $100$ time units, starting from the initial condition $y(0)=10^{-9}$.}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Erlang infectious periods don't allow variance	above one}
A distribution function $f(t)$ with survival function $F(t)$ and non-negative support is said to be in increasing failure rate class if the corresponding hazard function, $f(t)/F(t)$, is increasing, or, equivalently, $\ln F(t)$ is concave.
Erlang distribution, for example, belongs to this class \cite{leemis2023statistical}.
This implies the following property \cite{marshall1972classes}
\begin{equation}
F(a +b) < F(a) F(b). \label{eq_submultiplicative}
\end{equation}
Given \eqref{eq_CaseReproductiveNumber} and in view of  \eqref{eq_before_Markovian}, the second raw moment of $C(\tau, \rho)$
equals 
\begin{align*}
C_2 &= 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds F(t-\tau)\\
&\overset{\eqref{eq_submultiplicative}}{<} 2 \int_{\tau = 0}^\infty \int_{t=\tau}^\infty \int_{s=\tau}^t i(\tau)h(t)h(s)ds F(t-s)F(s-\tau)\\
\xrightarrow{\eqref{eq_C2final}} & < 2Z.
\end{align*}
Previously it has been shown that the mean of the expected case reproductive number, regardless of the infectious period distribution, is one yielding
$$
\frac{C_2}{Z} - 1 < 1.
$$

	\section{Instantaneous case reproductive number}
For the following SIR model,
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} &= - \beta(t)yx,\\
\dot{y} &= \beta(t) yx -y,
\end{align*}
we define the instantaneous case reproductive number associated with cohorts infected at time point $\tau$ as 
\[R_i(\tau) = \beta(\tau)x(\tau).\]
%Zeroth moment of $R_i$ is defined as
%\begin{align*}
%R_0 
%&= \int_{\tau} i(\tau) \\
%&= Z.
%\end{align*}
%The first raw moment of $R_i$ is then equal to 
%\begin{align*}
%R_1 &= \int_{\tau}d\tau i(\tau)\beta(\tau) x(\tau)
%\end{align*}
%The second raw moment of $R_i$ is equal to 
%\begin{align*}
%R_2 &= \int_{\tau} d\tau  i(\tau)  \beta^2(\tau) x^2(\tau) 
%\end{align*}

\section{Intrinsic generation-interval distribution and infectious period distribution}
The intrinsic generation-interval distribution, for a constant transmission rate, $g(t)$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
	g(t) = \frac{F(t)}{\int F(t) dt},
\end{equation}
where $F(t)$ is the survival function corresponding to the infectious period distribution \cite{champredon2015intrinsic}.

According to \cite[page 150]{feller} and \cite{chakraborti}, for a continuous non-negative random variable $t$ with survival function $F(t)$, the following relation holds:
\begin{equation} \label{eq_survial_higher}
	E(t^r) = \int_0^\infty r\tau^{r-1}F(\tau)d\tau, \quad r\geq 1.
\end{equation}
We then have
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 t^2 g(t) & = \frac{t^2F(t)}{\int F(t) dt}\\
  \int t^2 g(t) dt & = \frac{ \int t^2F(t) dt}{\int F(t) dt}\\
  \int t^2 g(t) dt & = \frac{E(t^3)}{3\int F(t) dt} \text{ (Using \Cref{eq_survial_higher}) } \\
  \int t^2 g(t) dt & = \frac{E(t^3)}{3E(t)} \text{ (Using \Cref{eq_survial_higher})}\\
   V_g + \mu^2_g & = \frac{E(t^3)}{3\mu_i} \\
    \kappa_g + 1 & = \frac{E(t^3)}{3\mu_i \mu^2_g} \\
         \kappa_g & = \frac{E(t^3)}{3\mu_i \mu^2_g} -1 \label{eq_cvg}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The means $\mu_i$ and $\mu_g$ are related by
\begin{equation} \label{eq_mug_mui}
	\mu_g = (1 + \kappa_i)\frac{\mu_i}{2}
\end{equation}
Substituting \Cref{eq_mug_mui} to \Cref{eq_cvg} results in
\begin{equation} \label{eq_cv2g}
 \kappa_g  = \frac{4E(t^3)}{3\mu_i^3 (1 + \kappa_i)^2} -1.
\end{equation}
%Defining coefficient of skewness, $\gamma_i$, as $E\big((\frac{t-\mu_i}{\sigma_i})^3\big)$, or, equivalently
%\begin{equation}
%	\gamma_i = \frac{E(t^3) - 3\mu_i \sigma^2_i - \mu^3_i}{\sigma^3_i},
%\end{equation}
%\Cref{eq_cv2g} can be written in terms of skewness and coefficient of variation:
%\begin{equation}
%\kappa_g  =	\frac{4\gamma_i\kappa^{3/2}_i + 12\kappa_i + 4}{3(1+\kappa_i)^2}-1
%\end{equation}
%\subsection{Using ration of means $\operatorname{PM}$ to simplify \Cref{eq_cv2g}}
%By defining
%\begin{align}
%	\operatorname{PM}_x(l+1) = \frac{\int x^{l+1}f(x) dx}{\int x^{l}f(x) dx}, \quad \text{for } l \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0},
%\end{align}
%we have $\operatorname{PM}_x(2) = \mu_x(1 + \kappa_x)$ and
%\begin{align*}
%\operatorname{PM}_x(3) &= \frac{\int x^{3}f(x) dx}{\int x^2f(x) dx}\\
%& = \frac{E(x^3)}{\mu^2_x(1 + \kappa_x)}.
%\end{align*}
%  \Cref{eq_cv2g} can be rewritten as follows:
%\begin{align}
%	\kappa_g = \frac{4}{3}\frac{\operatorname{PM}_i(3)}{\operatorname{PM}_i(2)} -1.
%\end{align}
%Moving $1$ to the left-hand side and replacing $1+\kappa_g$ by 
%$\operatorname{PM}_g(2)/\operatorname{PM}_g(1)$
%results in the equation:
%\begin{align}
%\frac{\operatorname{PM}_g(2)}{\operatorname{PM}_g(1)} = \frac{4}{3}\frac{\operatorname{PM}_i(3)}{\operatorname{PM}_i(2)}.
%\end{align}
\subsection{A new measure for skewness}
We define the coefficient $\phi$ as
\begin{align}
	\phi = \frac{\operatorname{E}(t^3)}{\mu^3 (1+\kappa)^2} -1,
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\kappa$ is the square of the coefficient of variation.
The third raw moment can be expressed in terms of $\mu$, $\kappa$, and $\phi$ as follows:
\begin{align} \label{eq_phi}
	\operatorname{E}(t^3) = \mu^3 (1+\kappa)^2 (1+\phi),
\end{align}
Substituting \Cref{eq_phi} for $\operatorname{E}(t^3)$ in \Cref{eq_cv2g} results in
\begin{equation}
	\kappa_g = \frac{1 + 4 \phi_i}{3}.
\end{equation}

For the gamma distribution, $\phi$ is equal to $\frac{\kappa}{\kappa + 1},$ and for the log-normal distribution, $\phi$ equals $\kappa$.
The calculation for the log-normal distribution is as follows:

For $\ln(x) \sim \mathcal{N}(M, S)$, the mean, variance, and the third raw moments are
\begin{align*}
	\mu & = \exp(M + S^2/2),\\ 
	\sigma^2 & = \exp(2M + S^2)\big(\exp(S^2) -1\big),\\
	\operatorname{E}(x^3)& = \exp(3M + \frac{9S^2}{2}).\\
\end{align*}
The square of coefficient of variation $\kappa$ is then
\begin{align*}
\kappa &= \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2}\\
 &= \frac{\exp(2M + S^2)\big(\exp(S^2) -1\big)}{\exp(2M + S^2)}\\
 & = \exp(S^2)-1.
\end{align*}
Substituting $\operatorname{E}(x^3)$, 
$\mu$, and $\kappa$ in \Cref{eq_phi} results in 
\begin{align*}
\exp(3M + \frac{9S^2}{2}) &= \big(\exp(M + S^2/2) \big)^3 \big(1 +\exp(S^2)-1 )^2 (1 + \phi)\\
 &= \exp(3M + 3S^2/2)\exp(2S^2)(1 + \phi)
\end{align*}
Dividing both sides by $\exp(3M + 3S^2/2)\exp(2S^2)$ results in 
$
	\exp(S^2) -1 = \phi,
$
or, equivalently, 
\begin{equation}
\phi = \kappa.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Special case: Erlang distribution}
If the infectious period is Erlang distributed with rate $\lambda$ and shape $1/\kappa$, then according to \cite[page 70]{walck2007hand}, we have
\begin{equation}
	E(t^n) = \frac{1}{\lambda^n} \prod_{m=0}^{n-1} (\frac{1}{\kappa} + m),
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
	E(t^3) = \frac{1}{\lambda^3}\frac{1}{\kappa}(\frac{1}{\kappa}+1)(\frac{1}{\kappa}+2),
\end{equation}
and given $\mu_i = \frac{1}{\kappa\lambda}$, and $\text{CV}^2_i = \kappa$,
 \Cref{eq_cv2g} simplifies to
\begin{align*}
\text{CV}^2_g  &= \frac{4(\frac{1}{\kappa}+2)}{3(\frac{1}{\kappa}+1)} -1\\
& = \frac{1 + 5\kappa}{3(\kappa +1)}
\end{align*}
